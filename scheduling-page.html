	<p>A "pump class," often referred to as a BODYPUMP class or "Power Pump," is a high-intensity,<br>
resistance-based fitness class that utilizes a barbell with light to moderate weights and a high number of repetitions<br>
to work all major muscle groups. These classes are designed to be fun,<br>
fast-paced, and effective for building lean muscle, improving endurance, and burning calories.</p>

<h3 id="five">Bootcamp</h3>
	<p>Bootcamp gym classes are high-intensity, group-based workouts<br>
that blend strength training, cardio, and calisthenics, often using interval training.<br>
They are designed to be challenging and foster a sense of community, with instructors often adopting a motivating,<br>
sometimes sergeant-like, approach. Expect a mix of exercises like<br>
push-ups, squats, lunges, and sprints, potentially using weights or resistance bands. </p>

	<p>Dancercise is a form of exercise that combines dancing with fitness,<br>
using choreographed dance routines to improve fitness levels.<br>
It's a fun and energetic way to get a workout,<br>
often done in classes with instructors guiding participants through various dance moves and styles. </p>

<h3 id="seven">Circuits</h3>
Typically, a circuit training class will consist of a number of different exercise stations being set up around a room.<br>
The participants will be split up into groups of two or three people<br>
each starting at one specific station and doing the exercise at that station for a set period of time.
