	<p>A "pump class," often referred to as a BODYPUMP class or "Power Pump," is a high-intensity,<br>
resistance-based fitness class that utilizes a barbell with light to moderate weights and a high number of repetitions<br>
to work all major muscle groups. These classes are designed to be fun,<br>
fast-paced, and effective for building lean muscle, improving endurance, and burning calories.</p>

that blend strength training, cardio, and calisthenics, often using interval training.<br>
They are designed to be challenging and foster a sense of community, with instructors often adopting a motivating,<br>
sometimes sergeant-like, approach. Expect a mix of exercises like<br>
push-ups, squats, lunges, and sprints, potentially using weights or resistance bands. </p>
